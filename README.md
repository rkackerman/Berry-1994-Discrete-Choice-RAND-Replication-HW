Berry-1994-Discrete-Choice-RAND-Replication-HW
==============================================
This repository contains the files associated with an assignment I completed for a graduate-level course on Industrial Organization.  The assignment details and supporting data are the creation of the course Professor.  The assignment replicates some results of Steven Berry's 1994 article "Estimating Discrete-Choice Models of Product Differentiation" published in Vol. 25, No. 2 of the RAND Journal of Economics in 1994.  The repository contains the following files:

1. "Berry HW.pdf" is the main HW submission and provides more detail on files 3-9
2. "Berry HW.tex" is the LaTeX file used to generate the previous pdf file.
3. "Berry HW Main.m" is the main MATLAB file (see number 1. for more detail).
4. "EQPriceObj.m" is a supporting MATLAB file (see number 1. for more detail).
5. "Berry HW.do" is a STATA file that executes part of the assignment (see number 1. for more detail).
6. "HW2_Ackerman.log" is a STATA log file detail the excecution of number 5. (see number 1. for more detail).
7. "observable_data.csv" is a supporting CSV file (see number 1. for more detail). 
8. "exog_data.csv" is a supporting CSV file (see number 1. for more detail). 
9. "STATA_data.csv" is a supporting CSV file (see number 1. for more detail). 



Note: These files were scrubbed of all course information to prevent future students from easily finding them.
